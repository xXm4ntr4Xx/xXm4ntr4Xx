### Hi there 👋

My name is Pietro, I'm 33 years old and I'm a software developer student at School of code.
I work as a Casino croupier on weekend, and during the week I work with other boot campers to become a software developer.
🔭 I’m currently working on the 4 weeks project at School of Code.\
In the last 13 weeks, I went from having no experience with coding to learning different things like:
-Difference between UX and UI.
-How to fetch data from an API
-How to work Agile methodology.
-How to set a tech stack.
-How to work Disney ideation(Dreamer, Realistic, Critic).
-How to use a Kanban Board to organize the project sprint.
-Difference between user Stories and User Personas.
-How to test your application (jest, cypress, superset).
-How to deploy your app online using Netlify, Heroku, gatsby cloud.
-Difference between frontend(javascript, React) and backend(node. js, express) how to connect them together using fetch.
-How typescript is growing up in the business and the advantage of using it and so many other things.....
